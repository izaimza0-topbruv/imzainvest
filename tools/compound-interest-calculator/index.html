                <h2>Understanding Compound Interest</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Compound interest is often called the "eighth wonder of the world" by investors, and for good reason. It's the single most powerful force for building wealth over time, and it's available to anyone with a bit of money and patience.
                </p>

                <h3>How It Works: The Simple Version</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine you invest £1,000 at an average return of 7% per year.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> You earn 7% on £1,000 = £70, leaving you with £1,070</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> You earn 7% on £1,070 = £75, leaving you with £1,145</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> You earn 7% on £1,145 = £80, leaving you with £1,225</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Notice something? Each year, you earn slightly more interest even though your return rate stays the same. That's compound interest — you're earning interest on your interest.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Time Matters More Than Money</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's where it gets really interesting. Consider two investors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sam starts at 15:</strong> Invests £250/month for 10 years, then stops. Total invested: £30,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Alex starts at 25:</strong> Invests £250/month for 40 years (until 65). Total invested: £120,000</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At age 65, assuming 7% annual returns, Sam likely has more than Alex. Why? Because Sam's £30,000 had 50 years to compound, while Alex's £120,000 had only 40 years. Time compounds exponentially.
                </p>

                <h3>The Power of Monthly Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    You don't need a lump sum to benefit from compound interest. Regular monthly contributions make a huge difference. Even £100-200 per month invested consistently over 20-30 years can turn into £100,000+ with compound interest doing much of the heavy lifting.
                </p>

                <h3>Using This Calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    The calculator above lets you experiment with different scenarios:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try different starting amounts</li>
                    <li>Adjust monthly contributions</li>
                    <li>Change time periods to see long-term impact</li>
                    <li>Experiment with different return rates (realistic: 5-8% for stock market investments)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Try this: Set it to start at 15, invest £250/month for 50 years at 7%. Then change it to start at 25. The difference is eye-opening.
                </p>

                <h3>Important Reminders</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This calculator is for <strong>educational purposes</strong> only</li>
                    <li>Past returns don't guarantee future results</li>
                    <li>Actual returns vary year to year (markets go up and down)</li>
                    <li>Inflation and taxes may affect your real returns</li>
                    <li>Never invest money you'll need in the next 5 years</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's a realistic annual return?</h3>
                    <p>UK stock market historical average: 7-8%. Bonds: 2-4%. Mixed portfolio: 5-6%. Use 7% for conservative estimates, but remember this varies year to year.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I invest in stocks or bonds?</h3>
                    <p>For teens with 30+ years until retirement, stocks typically offer better returns despite higher volatility. Bonds are safer but grow slower. Many use a mix.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do taxes affect these calculations?</h3>
                    <p>In a Junior ISA or regular ISA, UK taxes don't apply — it's tax-free growth. Outside an ISA, dividend tax and capital gains tax may apply. This calculator ignores taxes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if markets crash?</h3>
                    <p>Markets crash occasionally, but historically recover within 2-5 years. Over 20+ years, crashes barely matter. Keep investing through downturns.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I actually achieve these numbers?</h3>
                    <p>Historically, yes. But it requires consistent investing and staying invested. Most people abandon their strategy when markets drop. Discipline beats everything.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is this better than keeping money in a savings account?</h3>
                    <p>UK savings accounts currently pay 4-5% (2025). Stock market historically returns 7-8%. Over 20 years, the difference is massive: stock market wealth is often 2-3x higher.</p>
