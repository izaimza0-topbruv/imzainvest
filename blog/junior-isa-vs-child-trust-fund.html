                    If your parents opened an account for you as a baby, you might have a Child Trust Fund (CTF) sitting around. But there's a newer option now — Junior ISAs. Here's which one wins.
                </p>

                <h2>The Quick Answer</h2>
                <p><strong>Junior ISA wins.</strong> Better investment choices, lower fees, usually better rates. If you have an old CTF, consider transferring it.</p>

                <p>But let me explain why, because this stuff actually matters.</p>

                <h2>What Even Are These Things?</h2>

                <div class="comparison-box">
                    <div class="compare-item">
                        <h3>👶 Child Trust Fund (CTF)</h3>
                        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Government scheme that ran from 2002-2011. Every baby born in the UK got a voucher to invest.</p>
                        <p><strong>Who has one:</strong> Anyone born between 1 Sept 2002 and 2 Jan 2011</p>
                        <p><strong>Current allowance:</strong> £9,000/year</p>
                        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Closed to new accounts, but existing ones keep growing</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="compare-item">
                        <h3>📈 Junior ISA (JISA)</h3>
                        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The replacement for CTFs. Tax-free investing for under-18s.</p>
                        <p><strong>Who can open one:</strong> Any UK resident under 18 (parent/guardian opens it)</p>
                        <p><strong>Current allowance:</strong> £9,000/year (2025/26)</p>
                        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Active and the main option now</p>

                <h2>Why Junior ISAs Are Better</h2>

                <div class="reasons-grid">
                    <div class="reason-card">
                        <span class="reason-num">1</span>
                        <h4>More Investment Options</h4>
                        <p>CTFs were set up when the government was still figuring this out. Many CTF providers only offer a few basic funds.</p>
                        <p>JISAs give you access to thousands of funds, ETFs, and individual stocks. You can pick Vanguard, Trading 212, Freetrade, Hargreaves Lansdown — way more choice.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="reason-card">
                        <span class="reason-num">2</span>
                        <h4>Lower Fees</h4>
                        <p>This matters more than you think. A 1% difference in fees over 10 years can cost you <strong>thousands</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Old CTFs often charge 1-1.5% annually. Modern JISAs can be as low as 0.15-0.45%.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="reason-card">
                        <span class="reason-num">3</span>
                        <h4>Better Cash Rates</h4>
                        <p>If you want cash savings (not investing), JISA rates are usually higher. Some offer 4-5% on cash right now.</p>
                        <p>CTF cash rates are often terrible because providers know most people don't switch.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="reason-card">
                        <span class="reason-num">4</span>
                        <h4>More Competition</h4>
                        <p>Loads of providers offer JISAs, so they compete on price and features. CTFs are a dying product — fewer providers, less innovation.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Should You Transfer a CTF to a JISA?</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Short answer: Probably yes.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Since April 2015, you can transfer a CTF to a Junior ISA. Here's when it makes sense:</p>

                <div class="checklist-box">
                    <h4>✅ Transfer if:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your CTF has high fees (over 0.5%)</li>
                        <li>You want more investment choices</li>
                        <li>You want to use a specific provider (like Trading 212)</li>
                        <li>Your CTF cash rate is under 3%</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="checklist-box warning">
                    <h4>⚠️ Check first if:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your CTF has a loyalty bonus or guaranteed rate</li>
                        <li>You'd pay exit fees (rare, but check)</li>
                        <li>Your CTF is about to mature (turning 18 soon)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>How to Transfer CTF to JISA</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Open a Junior ISA</strong> with your chosen provider</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask the new provider</strong> for a CTF transfer form</li>
                    <li><strong>Fill it out</strong> with your old CTF details</li>
                    <li><strong>Wait 15-30 days</strong> for the transfer to complete</li>
                    <li><strong>Done!</strong> Your old CTF closes, money moves to JISA</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>You don't pay tax on the transfer, and your allowance doesn't change. The whole amount just moves over.</p>

                <h2>What Happens at Age 18?</h2>
                <p>Both accounts work the same way:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Money automatically becomes yours at 18</li>
                    <li>Account converts to an adult ISA in your name</li>
                    <li>You can withdraw, transfer, or keep investing</li>
                    <li>Adult ISA allowance: £20,000/year (2025/26)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Situation</h2>
                <p>I don't have a CTF (born after 2011), so I have a Junior ISA. But if you're 15-23 years old now, check if you have an old CTF your parents set up.</p>
                <p>The government voucher was only £250-500, but with growth over 15-20 years, some people have £5,000-£10,000 sitting in accounts they forgot about!</p>

                <div class="action-box">
                    <h4>🔍 Check if You Have a Lost CTF</h4>
                    <p>Go to the government's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-child-trust-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find a Child Trust Fund</a> page if you don't know who your provider is.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
                    <p>Junior ISAs beat CTFs in almost every way. If you have an old CTF, transfer it. If you're starting fresh, go straight to a JISA.</p>
                    <p>The £9,000 annual allowance is the same, but JISAs give you better choices, lower fees, and more control. That's an easy win.</p>
