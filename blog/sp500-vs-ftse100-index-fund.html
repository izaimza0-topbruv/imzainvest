                <p class="intro">
                    If you're a UK investor deciding where to put your money, you've probably seen two names come up again and again: S&P 500 and FTSE 100. Both are index funds. Both sound serious. But which one actually makes sense for your Junior ISA, Stocks & Shares ISA, or regular investment account?
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>🎯 The Quick Answer</h3>
                    <p>For long-term UK investors, <strong>S&P 500 is usually better than FTSE 100 alone</strong>. Why? Historical returns (8-10% vs 6-7%), more diversification (500 companies vs 100), and less exposure to UK economic risk. But the honest answer is: use both, or go global with an all-world index fund.</p>

                <p><strong>Translation:</strong> If you'd invested £1,000 in an S&P 500 index fund 10 years ago, it would be worth around £3,300 today. The same £1,000 in FTSE 100 would be worth around £2,100. That's a £1,200 difference from compound returns alone.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>📌 Important Caveat</h4>
                    <p>Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The S&P 500's outperformance is partly due to US tech dominance in the 2010s-2020s. This could change. Diversification still matters.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why Has S&P 500 Outperformed?</h2>
                
                <h3>1. US Tech Boom</h3>
                <p>The S&P 500 is heavily weighted toward technology (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla). The past 15 years have been the golden age of tech. FTSE 100 has minimal tech exposure — it's dominated by banks and oil companies instead.</p>

                <h3>2. Diversification</h3>
                <p>500 companies vs 100. The S&P 500 spreads risk across more sectors. FTSE 100's top 10 companies make up ~40% of the index. That concentration is riskier.</p>

                <h3>3. Global Earnings</h3>
                <p>S&P 500 companies earn revenue globally. Even a slowdown in the US doesn't kill them. FTSE 100 companies export commodities or financial services — they're more sensitive to global economic cycles.</p>

                <h3>4. UK Economic Headwinds</h3>
                <p>Post-Brexit, post-pandemic, UK growth has lagged the US. FTSE 100 reflects that. It's not the index's fault — it's just tracking the UK economy, which has been slower.</p>

                <h2>Costs & Fees: A Minor Factor</h2>
                
                <p>Fee differences are tiny. Here's what you'd pay on a typical UK platform:</p>
                
                <div class="fee-comparison">
                    <h4>Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Platform fee: 0.15%</li>
                        <li>Fund fee: 0.07%</li>
                        <li><strong>Total: 0.22% p.a.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="fee-comparison">
                    <h4>iShares UK Equity Index Fund (FTSE 100)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Platform fee: 0.15%</li>
                        <li>Fund fee: 0.06%</li>
                        <li><strong>Total: 0.21% p.a.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The difference is 0.01% — literally pence on a £1,000 investment. Don't choose your index based on this.</p>

                <h2>Currency Risk: A Real Consideration</h2>
                
                <p>S&P 500 is priced in US dollars. When you buy it with pounds, you're essentially betting on USD strength.</p>
                
                <div class="example-scenario">
                    <h4>Scenario 1: Pound weakens (good for US holdings)</h4>
                    <p>In 2023, the pound fell against the dollar. Your S&P 500 holdings became worth more in GBP, even if the index itself went flat. Bonus return.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-scenario">
                    <h4>Scenario 2: Pound strengthens (bad for US holdings)</h4>
                    <p>If the pound rallies in 2026, your S&P 500 holdings lose value just from currency movement. The index could be up 5%, but your GBP returns could be only 2% due to fx.</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Over 10+ years?</strong> Currency swings usually average out. You get some years of currency tailwind, some of headwind. It's not a reason to avoid S&P 500, but it's worth knowing about.</p>

                <h2>So Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
                
                <div class="choice-framework">
                    <div class="choice-card">
                        <h4>✅ Choose S&P 500 if:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You want growth over the next 10+ years</li>
                            <li>You're comfortable with some currency risk</li>
                            <li>You want international diversification</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="choice-card">
                        <h4>✅ Choose FTSE 100 if:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You want dividend income now</li>
                            <li>You want no currency risk</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="choice-card">

                            <li>You want the best of both worlds</li>
                            <li>You want true diversification</li>
                            <li>You can't decide (honestly, safest choice)</li>
                            <li>You want to reduce single-country risk</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>What We Actually Do</h2>
                
                <div class="our-choice">
                    <h4>🎯 Our Portfolio Breakdown</h4>
                    <p>Zo's Junior ISA is 70% global all-world index (FTSE All-World), which includes both UK and US, but is weighted globally. The remaining 30% is individual picks. She's not isolated to just FTSE 100 or just S&P 500 — the global index gives her exposure to both plus emerging markets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why?</strong> It's simple, diversified, and removes the "which one?" question. Global indexes are increasingly popular for exactly this reason.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Tax Treatment in UK ISAs</h2>
                
                <p>Here's the best part: it doesn't matter from a tax perspective.</p>
                
                <div class="tax-box">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inside a <strong>Stocks & Shares ISA</strong> or <strong>Junior ISA:</strong> Zero tax on gains, dividends, or growth</li>
                        <li>No capital gains tax</li>
                        <li>No income tax on dividends</li>
                        <li>No reporting to HMRC</li>
                        <li>Annual limit: £20,000 (adult ISA) or £9,000 (Junior ISA, 2025/26)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>This is why ISAs matter.</strong> The tax wrapper is more valuable than whether you pick S&P 500 or FTSE 100.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I buy S&P 500 or FTSE 100 for my Junior ISA?</h3>
                        <p>For a Junior ISA, S&P 500 or a global index is usually better than FTSE 100 alone because you have 10+ years for compound growth. FTSE 100's lower returns and income focus suit people needing dividends now, not teenagers saving for university.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I own both S&P 500 and FTSE 100?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely. Many investors hold both for diversification. Or you can use a global index (like FTSE All-World) that automatically gives you exposure to both plus 3,000+ other companies.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if the S&P 500 crashes?</h3>
                        <p>It will, eventually. Markets always crash. But if you're investing for 10+ years, history shows you recover and grow beyond previous highs. FTSE 100 also crashes. Diversification and time are your friends.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is S&P 500 overvalued right now?</h3>
                        <p>Possibly. US valuations are high in 2026. But trying to time the market is notoriously difficult. Dollar-cost averaging (investing monthly) helps smooth out valuations over time. Many investors use this approach.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need to worry about Brexit or UK risk with FTSE 100?</h3>
                        <p>FTSE 100 already reflects Brexit impacts. Most FTSE 100 companies earn 70%+ of revenue overseas. You're not betting solely on UK performance — you're betting on global commodity prices, banking stability, and oil markets.</p>
