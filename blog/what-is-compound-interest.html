                <p class="intro">
                    If you only learn one thing about investing, make it this. Compound interest is the reason why starting early matters more than starting with lots of money.

                    <h3>🎯 The Short Version</h3>
                    <p>Compound interest is when you earn interest on your interest. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill — it gets bigger and bigger, faster and faster.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Let's See It in Action</h2>
                <p>Say you invest £1,000 and it grows 7% per year (a reasonable long-term stock market return).</p>

                <h2>The Two Secrets to Compound Interest</h2>
                <div class="secrets-grid">
                    <div class="secret-card">
                        <span class="secret-number">1</span>
                        <h3>Start Early</h3>
                        <p>Time is the most important ingredient. Someone who starts at 15 has a massive advantage over someone who starts at 30, even if they invest less money.</p>
                        <div class="example-box">
                            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                            Zo invests £250/month from age 15 to 25 (10 years), then stops.<br>
                            Total invested: £30,000<br><br>
                            At age 45, that's worth <strong>£114,550</strong> (assuming 7% growth).<br><br>
                            Someone who starts at 25 and invests £250/month for 20 years (£60,000 total) would have... <strong>£123,456</strong>.<br><br>
                            Zo invested HALF as much but got nearly the same result. That's the power of starting early.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="secret-card">
                        <span class="secret-number">2</span>
                        <h3>Leave It Alone</h3>
                        <p>Compound interest needs time to work its magic. Every time you withdraw money, you break the cycle. The longer you leave it, the more powerful it becomes.</p>
                        <div class="example-box">
                            <strong>The Rule of 72:</strong><br>
                            Want to know how long it takes to double your money? Divide 72 by your growth rate.<br><br>
                            At 7% growth: 72 ÷ 7 = 10.3 years to double<br>
                            At 5% growth: 72 ÷ 5 = 14.4 years to double
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Why This Matters for Zo's Journey</h2>
                <p>We're aiming to turn £1,000 into £60,000 in 3 years. Is that realistic with compound interest alone?</p>
                
                <p> honestly? No. That would require 500% returns, which isn't realistic. But here's what IS realistic:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> £1,000 start + £3,000 added (£250/month) + growth ≈ £4,300</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> £4,300 + £3,000 added + growth ≈ £8,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> £8,000 + £3,000 added + growth ≈ £12,000</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>That's more realistic. To hit £60,000, we'd need either higher returns (risky), more monthly contributions, or a longer timeline. The point of this blog is to show what's actually achievable — not sell you a fantasy.</p>

                <h2>The Ugly Side of Compound Interest</h2>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>⚠️ It Works Both Ways</h4>
                    <p>Credit cards use compound interest too — but against you. A £1,000 credit card debt at 20% APR becomes £1,440 after 2 years if you don't pay it off. That's compound interest working for the bank, not you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Compound interest is your friend when investing. It's your enemy when you're in debt.</p>
