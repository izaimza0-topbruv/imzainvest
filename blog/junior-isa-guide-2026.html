                <p>As a parent or guardian in the UK, one of the smartest financial moves you can make for your child is opening a Junior ISA. The 2025/26 tax year gives you until <strong>5 April 2026</strong> to make the most of this powerful tax-free savings vehicle. With an annual allowance of £9,000 per child, a Junior ISA can grow to a substantial nest egg by the time your child reaches 18.</p>
                <p>But with so many platforms and options available, how do you choose? This guide walks you through everything you need to know about Junior ISAs in 2026.</p>
                <h2>What Is a Junior ISA?</h2>
                <p>A Junior ISA (JISA) is a tax-free savings and investment account designed specifically for children under 18. Any growth, interest, or dividends earned within the account are completely tax-free, allowing your child&#x27;s money to compound without the drag of income tax.</p>
                <p>The key difference from a regular savings account: <strong>your child cannot touch the money until they turn 18.</strong> This makes it perfect for long-term wealth building—whether you&#x27;re saving for university fees, a house deposit, or simply giving them a financial head start.</p>
                <h2>The 2026 Junior ISA Allowance: £9,000 Per Year</h2>
                <p>For the 2025/26 tax year (running until 5 April 2026), you can contribute up to <strong>£9,000 per child per year</strong> to a Junior ISA.</p>
                <p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s important:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Separate allowance:</strong> This £9,000 is separate from your own ISA allowance—contributing to your child&#x27;s JISA doesn&#x27;t eat into your £20,000 adult ISA limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Use it or lose it:</strong> Any unused allowance doesn&#x27;t carry over to the next tax year. If you don&#x27;t contribute £9,000 by 5 April, you lose that opportunity for that year.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple children:</strong> Each child has their own £9,000 allowance. If you have three children, you can invest up to £27,000 across their accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Anyone can pay in:</strong> Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles—anyone can contribute to a child&#x27;s JISA, though only parents/guardians can open it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Stocks &amp; Shares Junior ISA vs Cash Junior ISA</h2>
                <p>The first decision you&#x27;ll make is <strong>which type of Junior ISA</strong> to open. You can actually have both running simultaneously and split the £9,000 allowance between them.</p>
                <h3>Stocks &amp; Shares Junior ISA</h3>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Long-term growth, children with years until they turn 18.</p>
                <p>A Stocks &amp; Shares Junior ISA invests your money in investment funds, ETFs, bonds, or individual shares. Over a long time horizon (15+ years), stock market investments historically deliver higher returns than savings accounts.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Potential for significant growth over time</li>
                <li>Flexibility to choose your own investments</li>
                <li>Professional fund management available on most platforms</li>
                <li>Takes advantage of compound growth</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Investment value can fluctuate (falls as well as rises)</li>
                <li>You could get back less than you put in</li>
                <li>Requires basic investment knowledge or willingness to learn</li>
                <li>May feel riskier for cautious parents</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cash Junior ISA</h3>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lower risk, younger children, parents who want stability.</p>
                <p>A Cash Junior ISA works like a savings account—your money earns interest, but there&#x27;s no investment risk. Some platforms offer 3-4% interest rates (though rates vary).</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Capital is protected (no investment risk)</li>
                <li>Interest is guaranteed (up to the stated rate)</li>
                <li>Simple to understand</li>
                <li>Peace of mind for risk-averse parents</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Interest rates may not keep pace with inflation</li>
                <li>Lower long-term returns than stocks &amp; shares</li>
                <li>Money tied up until age 18</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to Choose</h3>
                <p><strong>Open a Stocks &amp; Shares JISA if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Your child is under 14 (more time to recover from market dips)</li>
                <li>You&#x27;re comfortable with some volatility</li>
                <li>You want maximum long-term growth potential</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Open a Cash JISA if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Your child is already 15-17 (preservation matters more than growth)</li>
                <li>You prefer guaranteed, stable returns</li>
                <li>You want simplicity and no investment decisions</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> Many parents split the allowance—say £5,000 into Stocks &amp; Shares and £4,000 into a Cash JISA for balanced exposure.</p>
                <h2>Best Platforms to Open a Junior ISA</h2>
                <h3>1. <strong>Trading 212</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why parents choose it:</strong> Trading 212 is the most affordable option. Zero fees means more of your child&#x27;s money stays invested.

                <p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Limited research tools compared to premium platforms; customer support can be slow during busy periods.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget-conscious parents, DIY investors, hands-on fund selection.</p>
                <h3>2. <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> £24.95/year flat fee (or 0.45% on balance over £5,500)</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> £100 one-off or £25/month</li>

                <li><strong>Target audience:</strong> Thorough investors, those who want research support</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why parents choose it:</strong> HL&#x27;s £24.95 annual fee is transparent and reasonable if you&#x27;re investing a decent lump sum. The breadth of choice (80,000+ investments) is unmatched, and their educational content helps you make informed decisions. HL&#x27;s award-winning customer service is a real advantage.</p>
                <p><strong>Downsides:</strong> The fee is higher than no-cost alternatives; their platform is more complex.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Parents who want hand-holding, extensive choice, and don&#x27;t mind a small annual fee.</p>
                <h3>3. <strong>AJ Bell Youinvest</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> £24/year or 0.24% (whichever is higher) after first year free</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> £1 (yes, really)</li>
                <li><strong>Investment choice:</strong> 15,000+ funds and shares</li>
                <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Streamlined, modern interface</li>
                <li><strong>Autopay:</strong> Yes, from £50/month</li>
                <li><strong>Target audience:</strong> Tech-savvy parents, those who like simplicity</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why parents choose it:</strong> AJ Bell offers a great middle ground—lower fees than HL, cleaner interface than Hargreaves, and solid fund selection. The ability to start with just £1 is excellent for testing the platform. After-hours support is responsive.</p>
                <p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Not as extensive fund selection as HL; fewer educational resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Tech-savvy parents wanting a modern, clean platform with reasonable fees.</p>
                <h3>4. <strong>Vanguard</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Depends on account type—typically 0.23% to 0.35% annually</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> £500 initial, then £100/month or lump sums</li>
                <li><strong>Investment focus:</strong> Vanguard funds primarily (index-based, low-cost)</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Index investing, passive strategy</li>
                <li><strong>Target audience:</strong> Long-term passive investors</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why parents choose it:</strong> Vanguard&#x27;s fees are competitive, especially for large balances. Their index funds are among the cheapest in the world. If you believe in &quot;set and forget&quot; investing, Vanguard is ideal.</p>
                <p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Limited fund choice (Vanguard funds only); fees are percentage-based, so they increase as balance grows; slightly less intuitive platform for beginners.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Parents committed to passive index investing, larger lump sums (£5,000+).</p>
                <h3>5. <strong>Interactive Investor</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> £99.99/year flat fee (covers up to 3 accounts)</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> £1,000 initial</li>
                <li><strong>Investment choice:</strong> 10,000+ funds and shares</li>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Strong analysis tools, detailed fund data</li>
                <li><strong>Target audience:</strong> Serious, analytical investors</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why parents choose it:</strong> Interactive Investor&#x27;s flat fee makes sense if you&#x27;re investing a large lump sum (£10,000+). Their annual charge becomes more economical the larger your balance. Great research tools.</p>
                <p><strong>Downsides:</strong> £99/year is expensive for smaller balances; £1,000 minimum gates entry; less beginner-friendly.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Parents investing substantial amounts (£15,000+) who want advanced tools.</p>

                <p>Link your bank account and make your first deposit. Minimum amounts vary (£1 to £1,000 depending on platform).</p>
                <p><strong>Step 5: Choose your investments</strong></p>
                <p>If opening a Stocks &amp; Shares JISA, select your funds or shares. If you&#x27;re unsure, many platforms offer ready-made portfolios for children (e.g., &quot;Growth Portfolio&quot; or &quot;Balanced Fund&quot;).</p>
                <h2>What Happens When Your Child Turns 18?</h2>
                <p>When your child reaches 18, their Junior ISA automatically converts into an adult Stocks &amp; Shares ISA <strong>in their own name</strong>. This is crucial: at 18, the money becomes theirs to control.</p>
                <p>Key points:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>They have access:</strong> Unlike the locked Junior ISA, they can now withdraw money or add more (up to their £20,000 adult ISA allowance).</li>
                <li><strong>Tax-free status continues:</strong> Any future growth remains tax-free as long as it&#x27;s invested through the ISA wrapper.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform choice:</strong> Some platforms (like Hargreaves Lansdown) automatically convert the account; others may require action.</li>
                <li><strong>Their ISA allowance:</strong> At 18, they get their own separate £20,000 annual ISA allowance. The converted Junior ISA continues to be invested separately.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Have a conversation with your child around age 16-17 about what will happen. It&#x27;s a great teaching moment about investing, compound growth, and financial responsibility.</p>
                <h2>Tax-Free Status: Why It Matters</h2>
                <p>Here&#x27;s why Junior ISAs are powerful:</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you invest £9,000 per year for 12 years (from age 6 to 18), with average 6% annual growth:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>In a Junior ISA (tax-free):</strong> £153,000</li>
                <li><strong>In a regular savings account (3% interest, taxed):</strong> £120,000</li>
                <li><strong>Difference:</strong> £33,000 extra—all because of tax-free growth</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is the power of the ISA wrapper: tax savings compound alongside your money.</p>
                <h2>Key Rules and Restrictions</h2>
                <p><strong>You must know these:</strong></p>
                <p>1. <strong>One of each type only:</strong> Your child can have maximum one Cash JISA and one Stocks &amp; Shares JISA open at any time. They can&#x27;t have two Trading 212 JISAs, for example.</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Can&#x27;t transfer between providers:</strong> Unlike adult ISAs, you can&#x27;t easily transfer a JISA to another platform. Once opened, it stays where it is.</p>
                <p>3. <strong>Parental access:</strong> Parents/guardians can see the balance and receive statements, but the child has legal ownership (they own the money, even though you control it until 18).</p>
                <p>4. <strong>Child Trust Fund holders:</strong> If your child has an old Child Trust Fund (for those born between 2002-2011), you can transfer it to a Junior ISA without using your £9,000 allowance that year.</p>
                <p>5. <strong>Contributions stop at 18:</strong> No more contributions can be made after their 18th birthday. That&#x27;s why maximising the allowance every year matters.</p>
                <h2>Common Questions About Junior ISAs</h2>
                <h3><strong>Q1: Can I move my child&#x27;s Junior ISA to a different platform?</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Not directly. Unlike adult ISAs, Junior ISAs aren&#x27;t easily transferable. However, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Close the existing JISA (you&#x27;ll get the cash back)</li>
                <li>Open a new JISA elsewhere</li>
                <li>Reinvest the funds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This creates a &quot;break&quot; where you lose the tax-free wrapper temporarily. It&#x27;s not ideal, so choose your platform carefully.</p>
                <h3><strong>Q2: Who can contribute to a Junior ISA?</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Anyone—parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, anyone. Only the parent or legal guardian can open it, but anyone can pay in. This makes Junior ISAs great for family contributions.</p>
                <h3><strong>Q3: What happens if I don&#x27;t use the full £9,000 allowance?</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> It&#x27;s lost forever. You can&#x27;t carry over unused allowance to the next tax year. If you only save £5,000 this year, the remaining £4,000 is gone. This is why it&#x27;s critical to prioritise contributions before 5 April.</p>
                <h3><strong>Q4: Can my child access the money before 18?</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> No, not in normal circumstances. The money is locked until age 18. This is actually a feature—it prevents your child from accessing funds impulsively and ensures long-term growth.</p>
                <h3><strong>Q5: Are there tax implications if my child earns money from the JISA?</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> No. The entire point of an ISA is to be tax-free. Growth, interest, dividends—all completely tax-free. Your child won&#x27;t pay income tax, capital gains tax, or dividend tax on JISA returns.</p>
                <h2>Action Steps: Before April 5, 2026</h2>
                <p>1. <strong>Decide between Cash and Stocks &amp; Shares</strong> (or a split)</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Choose your platform</strong> using the comparison above</p>
                <p>3. <strong>Apply online</strong> (takes 5-10 minutes)</p>
                <p>4. <strong>Fund your account</strong> before 5 April</p>
                <p>5. <strong>Set a reminder</strong> for next year—make it a habit to max out the allowance every April</p>
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Junior ISAs are one of the best financial tools available to UK parents. The tax-free growth, the locked-in commitment to saving, and the decades of compound growth make them a no-brainer if your child is under 18.</p>
                <p>Don&#x27;t let April 5 pass without making the most of this year&#x27;s allowance. Even if you can only spare £2,000-3,000, it&#x27;s worth doing. Over 18 years, that grows to a life-changing sum.</p>
                <p>The best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time is now.</p>
                <p><strong>Ready to open a Junior ISA?</strong> Start with Trading 212 for zero-cost investing, or Hargreaves Lansdown for maximum choice and support. Both are excellent for parents new to investing.</p>
