                <p class="post-subtitle">My story of researching, choosing, and buying Kraken Robotics—and why I think it could 10x.</p>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="intro">
                    I spent weeks researching before I bought my first actual stock. Not index funds. Not ETFs. A single company. Kraken Robotics (PNG). Here's how I did it, what I looked for, and why I'm convinced it's the right call.
                </p>

                <h2>The Starting Point: What Even is Stock Picking?</h2>
                <p>Most people will tell you to buy index funds and forget about it. And they're right—for most people, that's the sensible move. But I wanted to learn. I wanted to understand *why* companies go up and down. And I wanted a shot at outsized returns before I even finish secondary school.</p>
                <p>So I started researching. And that's when I stumbled on Kraken.</p>

                <h2>How I Found Kraken (The Research Rabbit Hole)</h2>
                <p>I wasn't looking for underwater drones. Honestly, I was scrolling through growth stock lists, looking for Canadian tech companies because they're smaller and more explosive. That's when I saw a message board discussion about subsea technology.</p>
                <p>"The ocean is the new space," someone wrote. I thought that was cool, so I clicked.</p>
                
                <div class="thesis-card">
                    <h4>📌 The Hook That Got Me</h4>
                    <p>A YouTube video showed autonomous underwater vehicles mapping the Arctic. And buried in the comments was a mention of Kraken Robotics—a Canadian company that supplies the sensors, batteries, and sonar for these drones.</p>
                    <p>I fell down the rabbit hole for a week.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What I Looked For (My Checklist)</h2>
                <p>Before I put a penny in, I created a simple checklist to evaluate Kraken:</p>

                <div class="research-checklist">
                    <div class="checklist-item">
                        <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
                        <h4>Real Products</h4>
                        <p>Does the company actually make something? Yes—batteries, sonar systems, and sensors for underwater vehicles. Not just software or ideas.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">
                        <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
                        <h4>Competitive Advantage</h4>
                        <p>Why can't anyone else do this? Kraken has patents on their subsea battery tech and has been building this for 15+ years. That's a moat.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">
                        <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
                        <h4>Real Catalysts Coming</h4>
                        <p>When will the stock price actually go up? I identified: the megafactory opening (done ✓), Ghost Shark production ramping, potential NASDAQ uplisting, defence spending increases.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">
                        <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
                        <h4>Cash in the Bank</h4>
                        <p>Can they survive a downturn? They had enough cash reserves to last 2+ years without new revenue. That's huge for a growth company.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">
                        <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
                        <h4>Smart Money Involved</h4>
                        <p>Did anyone credible already believe in this? Yes—institutional investors and strategic partnerships with Anduril (a serious defence tech company).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="checklist-item">
                        <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
                        <h4>Understandable Valuation</h4>
                        <p>Is it cheap or expensive? The stock was trading at a reasonable multiple of potential future revenue, not like a hype meme stock.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>The Ghost Shark Story (Why It Really Matters)</h2>
                <p>Here's the part that got me genuinely excited.</p>
                <p>Anduril, a top-tier US defence contractor, is building autonomous submarines called "Ghost Sharks" for the Australian Navy. These aren't toys—they're sophisticated military robots that cost millions each.</p>
                <p>And inside every Ghost Shark? Kraken's batteries. Kraken's sonar. Kraken's sensors.</p>
                <p>This is huge because military contracts have huge switching costs. Once Anduril chose Kraken, they're locked in. The Navy can't easily swap to a different supplier because certification takes years. So Kraken doesn't just make money once—they make money for the entire life of the contract.</p>
                <p>Anduril plans to build hundreds of these. If even 10% of the revenue goes to Kraken, that's tens of millions of pounds in the next 2-3 years.</p>

                <h2>The Megafactory Moment</h2>
                <p>This is what convinced Dad I wasn't just guessing.</p>
                <p>Kraken just built a $10 million manufacturing facility in Nova Scotia. Why? Because they finally have enough orders that they can't make everything in their old factory. The megafactory triples their production capacity.</p>
                <p>This is a classic growth signal: they're scaling because demand is real, not because they're desperate. And when a company can finally build what customers are ordering, the stock usually rewires.</p>
                <p>I bought 549 units between December 2025 and January 2026, averaging around £3.65. Total invested: about £1,998.</p>

                <h2>The Risks (Keeping It Brutally Real)</h2>
                <p>If I only talked about upsides, I'd be lying. Here's what could go wrong:</p>

                <div class="risks-grid">
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">💥</span>
                        <h4>Execution Risk</h4>
                        <p>The megafactory could have problems. Supply chain delays. Technical issues. Growth doesn't always go as planned.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">📉</span>
                        <h4>Stock Market Risk</h4>
                        <p>Even if Kraken does perfectly, the broader market could crash. Tech stocks especially get hammered in recessions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">🏛️</span>
                        <h4>Regulatory Risk</h4>
                        <p>New laws about subsea operations, export controls, or military tech could change the game overnight.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">💰</span>
                        <h4>Valuation Risk</h4>
                        <p>The stock is already pricing in a lot of future growth. If growth slows even a bit, the price could drop 30-50%.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><strong>This is why I only invested what I could afford to lose.</strong> If Kraken goes to zero, it hurts, but it doesn't derail the uni fund. Because I've also got <a href="why-index-funds-are-actually-op.html">index funds as the foundation</a>.</p>

                <h2>My Process (So You Can Steal It)</h2>
                <p>If you want to try individual stock picking, here's the actual workflow I use:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Find an idea.</strong> Stock forums, Reddit, YouTube, industry reports. Just find something that interests you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Read the latest earnings reports.</strong> These are free on the company's website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find analyst reports.</strong> Websites like Seeking Alpha have independent analysts breaking down companies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the fundamentals.</strong> How much cash do they have? How much debt? Is the business growing?</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand the bears' case.</strong> What could go wrong? Why might smart people disagree with you?</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for catalysts.</strong> What event in the next 6-24 months could drive the stock price up?</li>
                    <li><strong>Size it appropriately.</strong> Don't go all-in. If you're new, start small.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accept that you could be wrong.</strong> Have an exit plan. When would you sell?</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Where Kraken Stands Now</h2>
                <p>I bought in December 2025 and January 2026, averaging about £3.65 per share. I'm holding 549 units with a total investment of about £1,998.</p>
                <p>My thesis is still intact: the megafactory is ramping, Ghost Shark production is accelerating, and defence spending is up. So I'm holding.</p>
                <p>But I'm also watching for red flags. If quarterly reports show they're missing targets or the megafactory has problems, I'll reassess.</p>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>Here's what I've learned from picking my first stock:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research beats hype.</strong> I didn't buy because a YouTuber told me to. I bought because I understood the business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Catalysts matter.</strong> Time matters. A great company at the wrong time is just a money loser.</li>
                    <li><strong>Position size matters.</strong> I can take big risks on Kraken because it's only a portion of my portfolio. My base is index funds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diversification is real.</strong> I own Kraken, <a href="what-is-nebius-why-i-invested.html">Nebius (AI infrastructure)</a>, and KR1 (crypto). If one blows up, the others can carry me.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Stock picking isn't gambling if you do the homework. It's a skill. And like any skill, you get better with practice.</p>
