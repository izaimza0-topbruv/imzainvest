                <p>That's what I thought too. Turns out I was dead wrong.</p>
                <p>£100/month isn't going to make you rich overnight. But give it time, and compound interest does something genuinely mental. Let me show you the actual numbers.</p>

                <h2>The Raw Numbers: £100/Month at Different Timeframes</h2>

                <p>Read that last row again. £48,000 invested. <strong>£301,000 in free growth.</strong> That's the power of starting at 15 instead of 25.</p>

                <h2>Why Starting at 15 Is Actually Broken</h2>
                <p>This is the bit that blew my mind.</p>

                <div class="comparison-cards">
                    <div class="compare-card teen">
                        <h4>🟢 Person A: Starts at 15</h4>
                        <p>Invests £100/month for <strong>10 years</strong> (ages 15-25), then <strong>stops completely</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Total invested: £12,000</p>
                        <p><strong>Value at 45: ~£86,000</strong></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="compare-card adult">
                        <h4>🟡 Person B: Starts at 25</h4>
                        <p>Invests £100/month for <strong>20 years</strong> (ages 25-45), never stops.</p>
                        <p>Total invested: £24,000</p>
                        <p><strong>Value at 45: ~£58,900</strong></p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Person A invested <strong>half the money</strong>, stopped 20 years earlier, and still has MORE.</p>
                <p>That's not a typo. That's compound interest being absolutely unfair in the best way possible.</p>

                <h2>OK But Where Do I Actually Put £100/Month?</h2>
                <p>Right. Practical bit. Here's what I'd do (and basically what I am doing):</p>

                <div class="steps-list">
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">1</span>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Open a Junior Stocks & Shares ISA</h4>
                            <p>Tax-free growth until 18. Up to £9,000/year allowance. This is the obvious play for under-18s in the UK.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">2</span>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Pick a Low-Cost Platform</h4>
                            <p><a href="../resources/">Trading 212</a> (zero commission), Vanguard (low fees), or InvestEngine (free for ETFs). Don't pay fees you don't need to.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">3</span>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Buy a Global Index Fund</h4>
                            <p>Something like <strong>Vanguard FTSE All-World (VWRL)</strong> — 3,700+ companies in one fund. Instant diversification. Fees under 0.25%.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">4</span>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Set Up Auto-Invest</h4>
                            <p>Most platforms let you auto-invest monthly. Set it and forget it. Remove the temptation to check every day.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">

                        <div>
                            <h4>Don't Touch It</h4>
                            <p>Seriously. Markets dip. You'll see red months. The absolute worst thing you can do is panic sell. Just keep going.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>What If I Can Only Afford £50? Or £25?</h2>

                </div>

                <p>Even £25/month gets you nearly £40k over 30 years. The amount matters less than the consistency.</p>

                <h2>The Cost of Waiting</h2>
                <p>Every year you delay costs you more than you think.</p>

                <div class="delay-box">
                    <h4>⏰ £100/month — the price of delay</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start at 15</strong> → £349,000 by 55</li>
                        <li><strong>Start at 18</strong> → £272,000 by 55 (lost £77k)</li>
                        <li><strong>Start at 25</strong> → £149,000 by 55 (lost £200k)</li>
                        <li><strong>Start at 30</strong> → £98,000 by 55 (lost £251k)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Three years of waiting (15 → 18) costs you £77,000. That's the real price of "I'll start later."</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What I'm Actually Doing</h2>
                <p>My situation is different. Dad puts in £500/month and I'm going high-risk with individual stocks because I need £60k in 3 years for uni. That's NOT the safe play.</p>
                <p>If I was doing the sensible thing? I'd stick £100-250/month into VWRL inside a Junior ISA and not look at it for 10 years. Boring. But the numbers don't lie.</p>

                <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
                <p>Don't take my word for it. Plug your own numbers into our <a href="../tools/#compound-interest">Compound Interest Calculator</a> and see what your £100 could become.</p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
                    <p>£100/month invested from age 15 can become £149,000 by 45 — with only £36,000 actually invested. The rest is compound interest doing its thing.</p>
                    <p>You don't need to be rich to start investing. You need to be consistent and early. And if you're reading this at 15, you've already got the biggest advantage: time.</p>
