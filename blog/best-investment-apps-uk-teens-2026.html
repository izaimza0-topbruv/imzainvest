                <p class="intro">
                    When Zo started investing, we had no idea which platform to pick. There are SO many options. So we tried them. Here's our honest take on what works — and what doesn't — for teen investors in the UK.
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>🎯 Quick Answer</h3>
                    <p>If you want to skip the details: <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> is what we actually use for Zo's Junior ISA. UK's largest investment platform, FTSE 250 listed, 1.8 million clients, and the widest range of investments. If you want a simpler free option to learn with, <strong>Trading 212</strong> is excellent too.</p>

                <h2>What We Looked For</h2>
                <p>Not all investment apps are created equal — especially for teens. Here's what mattered to us:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Junior ISA support</strong> — Tax-free investing for under-18s</li>
                    <li><strong>Low or no fees</strong> — Every pound saved is a pound invested</li>
                    <li><strong>Low minimum</strong> — We started with £1,000, not £10,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Fractional shares</strong> — Buy £10 of a £300 share</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to use</strong> — Zo's 15, not a finance pro</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational tools</strong> — Practice mode, learning resources</li>
                </ul>

                        <p class="review-intro">This is where Zo's Junior ISA actually lives. The UK's largest investment platform — and we picked it for a reason.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What We Love</h4>
                        <ul class="pros">
                            <li><strong>Most trusted UK platform</strong> — FTSE 250 listed, 1.8 million clients, been around since 1981. Your money is with a serious institution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Widest investment choice</strong> — Over 2,500 funds, shares across global markets, ETFs, bonds. If it exists, HL probably has it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excellent research & tools</strong> — Wealth Shortlist (curated fund picks), detailed fund analysis, market news. Genuinely useful for learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>FSCS protected</strong> — Up to £85,000 covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</li>
                            <li><strong>Junior ISA with full control</strong> — Parent manages until 18, then it converts to a regular ISA in the child's name. £9,000 annual allowance (2025/26).</li>
                            <li><strong>Phone support</strong> — Actual humans you can call. Rare in fintech.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>What Could Be Better</h4>
                        <ul class="cons">
                            <li><strong>0.25% annual platform fee</strong> — Free platforms exist, but you're paying for reliability, research, and range. On a £5,000 portfolio that's £12.50/year.</li>
                            <li><strong>£11.95 per share deal</strong> — Individual stock trades aren't cheap. Funds are free to buy/sell though.</li>
                            <li><strong>No fractional shares</strong> — Can't buy £10 of a £300 stock. You buy whole shares.</li>
                            <li><strong>App feels more "adult"</strong> — Not as slick as Trading 212, but it's a proper investment platform, not a trading game.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>No, a 15-year-old cannot open an investment account alone. However, a parent or guardian can open a <strong>Junior ISA (JISA)</strong> on their behalf. The parent manages the account until the child turns 18, when it converts to a regular ISA in their name.</p>

                        <p>Investment apps require users to be 18+ to open their own account. For teens under 18, a parent must open a Junior ISA. Some apps like Trading 212 allow the teen to help manage investments with parental oversight.</p>

                        <p>Trading 212 is regulated by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and covered by the FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) up to £85,000. Your investments are held separately from the company's funds. However, all investing carries risk — you could lose money.</p>

                        <h3>What's better: Trading 212 or Vanguard?</h3>
                        <p>For beginners with small amounts (£1-£10k), <strong>Trading 212</strong> is better due to zero fees, practice mode, and fractional shares. For larger portfolios (£10k+), <strong>Vanguard</strong> may be better due to ultra-low fund fees (0.15%). We use Trading 212 now, may switch to Vanguard later.</p>

                        <h3>How much should a teen invest per month?</h3>
                        <p>There's no right answer, but we recommend starting with what you can afford to lose. Zo invests £250/month — a balance between building good habits and not overcommitting. Even £25/month adds up over time thanks to compound interest.</p>

                        <h3>Do these apps charge hidden fees?</h3>
                        <p>The apps we reviewed (Trading 212, Freetrade, InvestEngine, Vanguard) don't charge hidden fees, but there may be FX fees (0.15% on Trading 212 for non-GBP stocks) and fund management fees (built into ETF prices). Always read the fee schedule.</p>
