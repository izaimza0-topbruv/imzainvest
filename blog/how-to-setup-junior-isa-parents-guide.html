                <p class="intro">
                    One of the best financial decisions we made was opening Zo's Junior ISA at age 13. It's tax-free. It's flexible. And it teaches kids about investing early. If you've been thinking about it but don't know where to start, this guide takes you through every step — from choosing a platform to making your first investment.
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>🎯 TL;DR: The Setup Process</h3>
                    <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> 15-30 minutes<br>
                    <strong>You'll need:</strong> Your ID, National Insurance number, child's birth certificate/passport<br>
                    <strong>Cost:</strong> Free (0-0.25% depending on platform)<br>
                    <strong>Tax benefit:</strong> £9,000/year grows tax-free until your child turns 18</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why a Junior ISA Matters (Before You Start)</h2>
                
                <p>Here's the reality: most UK children never discuss money with their parents until they're in debt. A Junior ISA changes that.</p>
                
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h4>The Tax Angle</h4>
                    <p>Your child could invest £9,000/year with zero tax on growth. In a regular savings account earning 4%, they'd pay tax on the interest. In a Junior ISA, they don't. Over 10 years, that could be thousands of pounds difference.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h4>The Habit Angle</h4>
                    <p>Kids who invest young think differently about money. They see the connection between saving, investing, and wealth-building. Zo says it's made her more conscious about spending.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h4>The Time Angle</h4>
                    <p>Compound interest works best with time. £250/month from age 13-18 in a Stocks & Shares ISA (7% returns) becomes ~£21,000 by age 18. That's real money for university, a house deposit, or a gap year.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Step 1: Decide Between Cash and Stocks & Shares</h2>
                
                <p>This is your biggest decision. It determines risk and potential returns.</p>

                    <h4>🎯 Our Choice (And Why)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Stocks & Shares for Zo.</strong> She's 15, with 3 years until university. Historically, stock markets recover from downturns in 5+ years. If she needs the money in 2028, we'd have chosen cash. But for medium-to-long term, stocks win on returns.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Step 2: Choose Your Platform</h2>
                
                <p>This matters more than you think. The "best" platform depends on your priorities: fees, choice, ease, or support.</p>

                    <h4>Our Honest Recommendation</h4>
                    <p><strong>For most UK parents:</strong> Start with <strong>Trading 212</strong> (free, practice mode, learn together). Once your teen is confident (2-3 months), open a <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> Junior ISA for serious long-term investing.</p>
                    <p>Why two accounts? Trading 212 is for education and lower stakes. HL is for the real money where you want the most choices and support.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why:</strong> 3,000+ companies in one fund. Instant diversification. Minimal effort.</p>

                        <p>Per child, per tax year (April 5 - April 4). You can't exceed it. If you have multiple children, each gets £9,000. Set a reminder for April 5th.</p>

                        <p>The money is locked until your child turns 18 (rare exceptions: terminal illness). That's the trade-off for the tax break. If you might need it sooner, consider a regular savings account instead.</p>

                        <p>Your child can have ONE Cash Junior ISA and ONE Stocks & Shares Junior ISA (up to £9,000 combined). If they switch platforms, you need to transfer (not withdraw) to keep the tax wrapper.</p>

                        <p>If your child has an old Child Trust Fund, you'll need to transfer it to a Junior ISA. You can't have both. Transfers are free and take 2-4 weeks.</p>

                        <p>Parent/guardian is the account owner. At 16, your child can "request" investments (you can accept or refuse). At 18, it becomes fully theirs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Your child gets full control:</strong> They can withdraw, reinvest, or keep building.</p>
                    <p><strong>New allowance unlocks:</strong> Adult ISA allowance is £20,000/year (vs £9,000 for Junior). They can continue investing tax-free.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> At 18, they legally own the money. If they want to spend it on a car or gap year, they can. This is why teaching good habits during the Junior ISA years matters.</p>

                        <h3>Can a child manage their own Junior ISA?</h3>
                        <p>Not until age 16, and only with parental permission. From 16-18, they can suggest investments, but you retain full control. At 18, it becomes theirs entirely. This is good — it gives them agency without letting them make costly mistakes.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if we move abroad — can we keep the Junior ISA?</h3>
                        <p>If you leave the UK, the Junior ISA usually stops accepting contributions, but existing money stays invested. Check with your provider. Different rules apply for Crown employees and some expatriates.</p>
