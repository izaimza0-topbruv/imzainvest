                    A Junior ISA (JISA) is one of the best ways to save or invest for a child in the UK. Tax-free growth, locked until 18, and for the 2025/26 tax year, you can put in up to £9,000. Here's how they work.
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>🎯 Quick Facts</h3>
                    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Annual allowance:</strong> £9,000 (2025/26 tax year)</li>
                        <li><strong>Who can open:</strong> Parent or guardian</li>
                        <li><strong>Who can contribute:</strong> Anyone (family, friends)</li>
                        <li><strong>When child can access:</strong> Age 18</li>
                        <li><strong>Tax status:</strong> No tax on growth or income</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>What is a Junior ISA?</h2>
                <p>A Junior Individual Savings Account (JISA) is a tax-free savings or investment account for children under 18. The money is locked away until the child turns 18, at which point it becomes theirs to use however they want.</p>
                
                <p>There are two types:</p>
                
                <div class="types-grid">
                    <div class="type-card">
                        <h4>💰 Cash Junior ISA</h4>
                        <p>Like a savings account, but tax-free. Your money earns interest with zero risk.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Safe — no chance of losing money</li>
                            <li>Lower returns (currently 3-5%)</li>
                            <li>Good for short-term or cautious savers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="type-card">
                        <h4>📈 Stocks & Shares Junior ISA</h4>
                        <p>Invest in funds, shares, or ETFs. Growth is tax-free, but values can go down.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Higher potential returns (historically 7%+ long-term)</li>
                            <li>Risk — values can fall</li>
                            <li>Best for long-term (10+ years)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>A child can have <strong>one of each type</strong>, and you can split the £9,000 allowance between them however you like.</p>

                <h2>Who Can Open a Junior ISA?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parents or legal guardians</strong> can open a JISA for a child under 18</li>
                    <li>The child must live in the UK</li>
                    <li>The child <strong>cannot</strong> have a Child Trust Fund (CTF) — if they do, you'd need to transfer it to a JISA first</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>📌 Important</h4>
                    <p>Only the parent/guardian can open the account, but <strong>anyone</strong> can pay into it. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends — all can contribute up to the £9,000 annual limit.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The £9,000 Allowance Explained</h2>
                <p>For the 2025/26 tax year (6 April 2025 to 5 April 2026), you can put up to <strong>£9,000</strong> into a child's JISA.</p>
                
                <div class="allowance-examples">
                    <h4>How you could use it:</h4>
                    <div class="example-row">
                        <span class="method">£750/month</span>
                        <span class="result">= £9,000/year (maximum)</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example-row">
                        <span class="method">£250/month</span>
                        <span class="result">= £3,000/year + room to grow</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example-row">
                        <span class="method">£9,000 lump sum</span>
                        <span class="result">= Done for the year</span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Use it or lose it — unused allowance doesn't roll over to the next year.</p>

                <h2>What Happens at Age 18?</h2>
                <p>When the child turns 18:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Junior ISA automatically converts to a regular (adult) ISA in their name</li>
                    <li>They get full control of the money</li>
                    <li>They can withdraw some or all of it, or keep it invested</li>
                    <li>They can continue adding up to the adult ISA allowance (£20,000 for 2025/26)</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>⚠️ They Get Full Control</h4>
                    <p>At 18, the money is legally theirs. They could withdraw it all and spend it on whatever they want. This is why financial education matters — teaching them to use it wisely (university, house deposit, etc.) before they turn 18.</p>
                </div>

                        <h3>Can my child access the money before 18?</h3>
                        <p>No. Junior ISA money is locked until the child turns 18. There are very limited exceptions (terminal illness, death). If you might need access earlier, consider a different savings option.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if my child has a Child Trust Fund?</h3>
                        <p>You can't have both a CTF and a JISA. However, you can <strong>transfer</strong> a CTF to a JISA. Contact your chosen JISA provider to initiate the transfer.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I transfer a Junior ISA to another provider?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. You can transfer a JISA to a different provider at any time. The new provider handles the transfer — don't withdraw the money yourself or you'll lose the tax benefits.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can the child manage the investments?</h3>
                        <p>The parent/guardian manages the account until the child turns 16. At 16, the child can take over management (but still can't withdraw until 18).</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if I put in more than £9,000?</h3>
                        <p>You can't. Providers won't accept contributions over the limit. If you somehow manage to exceed it, HMRC may charge a penalty.</p>
