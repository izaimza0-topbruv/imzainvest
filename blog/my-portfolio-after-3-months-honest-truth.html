                <h1>My Portfolio After 3 Months — The Honest Truth</h1>
                <p class="post-subtitle">Started December 2025 with £5,474. Now I'm down 6.7%. Here's everything.</p>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="intro">
                    Three months ago, I started my investing journey with some Christmas money and birthday gifts. I put £5,474 into a Junior ISA. Fast forward to February 2026, and my portfolio is down £367. Not exactly "10x in 2 years" energy. Here's the real story—wins, losses, and everything I've learned.
                </p>

                <h2>The Setup: December 2025</h2>
                <p>I opened a Junior ISA in early December 2025. The account is tax-free (any gains I make aren't taxable until I'm 18). That's a huge advantage for long-term investing.</p>
                <p>My first move was boring: I put 60% into a global tracker fund. Intentionally boring. Not flashy. Just compounding.</p>
                <p>Then I got risky.</p>
                <p>The remaining 40% went into individual stock picks:</p>

                <div class="setup-card">
                    <h3>My Allocation (December 2025)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>60%:</strong> Global index funds (Vanguard FTSE All-World ETF)</li>
                        <li><strong>20%:</strong> Kraken Robotics (PNG) — £1,998 invested</li>
                        <li><strong>12%:</strong> Nebius (NBIS) — £2,476 invested (added in January)</li>
                        <li><strong>5%:</strong> KR1 plc (inherited from account history)</li>
                        <li><strong>3%:</strong> Cash reserves</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>The Three Months: December → February 2026</h2>
                <p>A lot happened. Let me walk through each position:</p>

                <h3>Kraken Robotics (PNG) — The Winner 🟢</h3>
                <p>This is the one that's working.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bought:</strong> December 2025 and January 2026</li>
                    <li><strong>Total invested:</strong> £1,998 (549 units)</li>
                    <li><strong>Current value:</strong> ~£2,140</li>
                    <li><strong>Return:</strong> +7% (gain of ~£142)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>PNG is up because the megafactory is ramping, Ghost Shark production is accelerating, and defence spending is climbing. My reasoning is playing out. The stock even beat analyst expectations in Q4, which surprised a lot of people.</p>
                <p>But here's the thing—this feels lucky, not smart. If the stock had fallen 10%, would my thesis be wrong? No. The fundamentals are the same. So right now I'm riding a wave of good luck and actual belief. I'm holding.</p>

                <h3>Nebius (NBIS) — The Contrarian Loss 🔴</h3>
                <p>This one hurts because I really believe in it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bought:</strong> 22 January 2026</li>
                    <li><strong>Total invested:</strong> £2,476 (34 units at £72.83)</li>
                    <li><strong>Current value:</strong> ~£2,222</li>
                    <li><strong>Return:</strong> -10% (loss of ~£254)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nebius is down because the broader market has gotten spooked about AI profitability. Everyone's asking: "Wait, are companies actually making money from AI, or is it just hype?"</p>
                <p>That's a fair question. And Nebius's valuation got crushed because of it.</p>
                <p>But my thesis hasn't changed. The GPU shortage is real. Data centre demand is real. I'm actually considering buying more if it falls further.</p>
                <p>This is where patience matters. If I sell Nebius now, I lock in a £254 loss. If I hold for 3 years and AI infrastructure booms like I think it will, this looks like the bargain of a lifetime.</p>

                <h3>KR1 — The Disaster 🔴🔴</h3>
<div style="background:#F8D7DA;border:1px solid #F5C2C7;border-radius:8px;padding:16px 20px;margin:16px 0;font-size:14px;line-height:1.6;color:#842029;">
  <strong>🔴 High-Risk Investment Warning:</strong> KR1 plc is a cryptocurrency and digital asset investment company. Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you are unlikely to be protected if something goes wrong.

</div>

                <p>This position I didn't even choose. It came with the account when I inherited it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Original:</strong> 4,141 units inherited</li>
                    <li><strong>Current value:</strong> ~£955</li>
                    <li><strong>Return:</strong> -27% (loss of ~£352)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>KR1 is a crypto company. Crypto is volatile. When I inherited this position, it was worth ~£1,300. Now it's £955. That's rough.</p>
                <p>But here's the thing—I didn't buy this, so it doesn't feel like "my" loss. It's more like a lesson: crypto is speculative. If this goes to zero, I'm not devastated. But if crypto rallies again, it could bounce back to £1,500+.</p>
                <p>I'm watching it, but I haven't added more money to this position.</p>

                <h2>The Real Portfolio Picture</h2>
                <p>So when you add it up:</p>

                <div class="portfolio-summary">
                    <div class="summary-row">
                        <span class="label">Total Invested:</span>
                        <span class="value">£5,474</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="summary-row">
                        <span class="label">Current Value:</span>
                        <span class="value">£5,107</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="summary-row negative">
                        <span class="label">Overall Return:</span>
                        <span class="value">-6.7% (-£367)</span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Not great. But here's the nuance: my index fund portion is probably up 2-3%, and my picks are dragging down the overall return.</p>
                <p>This is exactly why diversification exists.</p>

                <h2>What's Changed About My Thesis?</h2>
                <p>Honest answer: not much.</p>
                <p>I still believe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kraken Robotics has real catalysts coming (Ghost Shark, NASDAQ uplisting, defence spending)</li>
                    <li>Nebius is positioned for the AI infrastructure boom</li>
                    <li>KR1 is a lottery ticket, and I'm holding it</li>
                    <li>Index funds will quietly compound at 7-8% per year no matter what</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The only thing that's changed is I'm more confident in my process. I did the research. I understand why I bought these stocks. And when the market got spooked, I didn't panic.</p>
                <p>That's the skill right there: <a href="how-i-picked-my-first-stock-at-15.html">having a thesis and sticking to it</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Lessons (Without Sounding Preachy)</h2>

                <div class="lessons-grid">
                    <div class="lesson-card">
                        <h4>📉 Lesson 1: Volatility is Normal</h4>
                        <p>Being down 6.7% after 3 months feels bad, but it's nothing. I'm 15. My time horizon is decades. Three-month moves are noise.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-card">
                        <h4>⚡ Lesson 2: Timing Matters</h4>
                        <p>I bought Nebius at £72.83 when the stock was euphoric. If I'd waited a month, I could've bought at £65. This isn't a failure—it's data. Buy in tranches, not all at once.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-card">
                        <h4>🔄 Lesson 3: Diversification Saves You</h4>
                        <p>If my entire portfolio was Nebius, I'd be down 10%. Instead, I'm down 6.7% because index funds are steadier. This is deliberate.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-card">
                        <h4>🧠 Lesson 4: Emotion is the Enemy</h4>
                        <p>When Nebius dropped, I felt the sting. But I didn't sell. I reviewed my thesis, confirmed it was sound, and held. Emotion makes you sell winners too early and hold losers too long.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-card">
                        <h4>💡 Lesson 5: Information Asymmetry Matters</h4>
                        <p>I read Kraken's earnings report. Most retail investors didn't. I understood the Ghost Shark narrative. They didn't. That's why I had conviction to hold when the stock dipped.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-card">
                        <h4>🎯 Lesson 6: Conviction Requires Sizing</h4>
                        <p>I could afford to be down 6.7% because my high-conviction bets (Kraken, Nebius) were only 32% of my portfolio. The other 60% is working quietly in the background.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Would I Do Anything Different?</h2>
                <p>Actually, no. Here's why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On Kraken:</strong> I'd buy more if I had cash. The thesis is even stronger now.</li>
                    <li><strong>On Nebius:</strong> I'd hold. I might add if it fell another 10%, but selling now is the wrong move.</li>
                    <li><strong>On KR1:</strong> I'd hold this too. It's speculative, but I didn't use "my" money to buy it, so I can be patient.</li>
                    <li><strong>On index funds:</strong> I'd stick with this forever. Zero regrets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The only thing I might've done differently is buy Nebius in two tranches instead of one lump sum. But that's microoptimisation.</p>

                <h2>What's Next? (The Next 3 Months)</h2>
                <p>I'm watching for a few things:</p>
                
                <div class="thesis-card">
                    <h4>📅 Key Catalysts</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Kraken Q4 earnings</strong> (should be strong based on orders)</li>
                        <li><strong>Nebius revenue growth</strong> (is GPU demand still accelerating?)</li>
                        <li><strong>NASDAQ uplisting decision</strong> (Kraken might announce timing)</li>

                <p>I'm also planning to add £200-500 per month to my index fund position. Boring, but that's where the real wealth will come from.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>I'm down £367 after three months. It's not ideal, but it's not catastrophic either. More importantly, I now understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to research stocks</li>
                    <li>How to size positions appropriately</li>
                    <li>How to manage emotions during volatility</li>
                    <li>Why diversification matters</li>
                    <li>That I can be wrong, and it's okay</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If I invested £1,000 in <a href="why-index-funds-are-actually-op.html">index funds</a> every month for the next 10 years, I'd have ~£150,000 by the time I'm 25. That's the foundation.</p>
                <p>But if I pick stocks intelligently, take calculated risks, and hold for the long term? Maybe I hit £200,000 instead.</p>
                <p>This portfolio is my real-time education. Every loss teaches me something. Every win builds confidence. And at 15, with a 50+ year runway, I can afford to experiment.</p>
