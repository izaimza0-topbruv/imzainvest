                <h1>What Happens to Your Money When You Buy a Stock?</h1>
                <p class="post-subtitle">The actual mechanics of stock ownership — where the money goes, who profits, and why it matters.</p>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="intro">
                    I clicked "buy" on Trading 212 for the first time and wondered: where does my money actually go? Is it funding the company? Going to the previous owner? Getting eaten by some invisible middleman? Turns out, it's way more complicated (and interesting) than I thought.
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>🎯 The Short Version</h3>
                    <p>When you buy a stock, you're buying a tiny slice of ownership. Your money mostly goes to the person selling (not the company). Stock prices move based on supply and demand — think eBay for company ownership. The difference between your buying price and selling price is your gain (paper gain while you hold it, realised gain when you sell).</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What Actually Is a Stock Share?</h2>
                <p>A share is literally a piece of a company. Imagine your school splitting into 1,000 equal pieces and selling them off. If you bought 10 pieces, you'd own 1% of the school. You'd get a vote on big decisions and a claim on any profits.</p>

                <p>That's exactly what a stock is. When you own 100 shares in Apple, you own 100 tiny pieces of Apple. You get:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A claim on profits:</strong> If Apple makes billions in profit, a tiny bit of that is technically yours (though they usually reinvest it)</li>
                    <li><strong>Voting rights:</strong> You can vote on company decisions (though with 100 shares out of billions, your vote is basically a rounding error)</li>
                    <li><strong>Potential growth:</strong> If Apple becomes more valuable, your shares become more valuable</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk exposure:</strong> If Apple tanks, your investment tanks too</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are also dividend stocks, where companies pay shareholders cash regularly. But that's another post.</p>

                <h2>Where Does Your Money Actually Go?</h2>
                <p>Here's the mental shift that confused me: <strong>your money doesn't necessarily go to the company</strong>.</p>

                <p>When a company first goes public (IPO = Initial Public Offering), they sell shares directly to investors. That money goes to the company. They use it to build factories, hire people, research new products — actual stuff.</p>

                <p>But after that IPO? You're almost never buying directly from the company. You're buying from other investors who already own shares.</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Real example:</strong><br>
                    In 2015, I buy Apple stock at £100/share. That money goes to whoever sold me those shares — could be an investment fund, a retiree, a day trader, anyone.<br><br>
                    Apple doesn't see a penny.<br><br>
                    In 2025, you buy Apple stock at £250/share. That money goes to me (or whoever I sold to). Apple still doesn't see a penny.<br><br>
                    For most of Apple's stock trading, Apple is nowhere in the transaction.
                </div>

                <p>This is actually brilliant for companies — they can raise money once during an IPO, then their shares trade forever without them doing anything. Wild.</p>

                <h2>Enter the Market Makers (the Invisible Middlemen)</h2>
                <p>So if I'm selling and you're buying, how do we find each other? That's where market makers come in.</p>

                <p>A market maker is basically a financial institution that guarantees liquidity. They buy stocks from people trying to sell, and sell stocks to people trying to buy. They pocket the difference (called the "bid-ask spread").</p>

                <div class="flow-diagram">
                    <div class="flow-step">You want to buy Apple</div>
                    <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
                    <div class="flow-step">Market maker sells you their Apple shares</div>
                    <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
                    <div class="flow-step">Market maker keeps 0.01% as profit (the spread)</div>
                    <div class="flow-arrow">→</div>
                    <div class="flow-step">Market maker immediately buys from someone else to restock</div>
                </div>

                <p>This happens thousands of times per second. Market makers don't really "own" stocks long-term — they're just the pump that keeps the market flowing. On Freetrade or Trading 212, the spreads are tiny for popular stocks, but they're still there.</p>

                <h2>Why Do Stock Prices Move?</h2>
                <p>Stock prices aren't set by the company. They're set by supply and demand — just like a Depop listing.</p>

                <p>If everyone thinks Apple will do well, more people want to buy than sell. Price goes up. If everyone thinks Apple is overpriced, more people want to sell than buy. Price goes down.</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <strong>Real scenario:</strong><br>
                    Apple releases earnings. Profit is down 5%. The market thinks "hmm, not good." More people want to sell than buy. Price drops to £240.<br><br>
                    Next day, an analyst publishes a report saying "Apple's new products will crush it in 2026." Now more people want to buy. Price shoots up to £260.<br><br>
                    The company didn't change overnight. The market's opinion did.
                </div>

                <p>This is why stock prices seem random sometimes. The market is literally just thousands of people arguing about what a company is worth, moment by moment. Sometimes that's based on earnings. Sometimes it's based on vibes.</p>

                <h2>Paper Gains vs Realised Gains</h2>
                <p>This is crucial to understand, and I got it wrong at first.</p>

                <p><strong>Paper gain:</strong> You bought Tesla at £100/share. It's now £150/share. You're up £50 per share. That's a paper gain. It only exists on your screen. If you sell right now, it becomes real.</p>

                <p><strong>Realised gain:</strong> You sell that Tesla at £150/share. The money hits your account. That's your realised gain. It's real.</p>

                <div class="comparison-box">
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Paper Gain</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You still own the stock</li>
                            <li>Price could go back down tomorrow</li>
                            <li>You haven't paid taxes on it yet</li>
                            <li>It's not in your bank account</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-item">
                        <h4>Realised Gain</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You sold the stock</li>
                            <li>Money is in your account</li>
                            <li>You owe capital gains tax (in most cases)</li>
                            <li>It's real, permanent, and yours</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>A lot of beginning investors get attached to paper gains. "Oh look, I'm up £2,000!" But that money doesn't exist until you sell. If the stock crashes before you sell, that paper gain vanishes.</p>

                <p>This is also why long-term investing works — you let your paper gains compound into massive realised gains. You don't get tempted to sell every time there's a dip.</p>

                <h2>The Chain Reaction: How a Stock Purchase Actually Works</h2>
                <p>Let me walk through exactly what happens when you click "buy" on Trading 212:</p>

                <div class="step-by-step">
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">1</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <h4>You hit "Buy"</h4>
                            <p>You want 1 share of Apple at market price.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">2</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <h4>Your app sends a request to the market</h4>
                            <p>Trading 212 connects you to the stock exchange (LSE for UK stocks, NASDAQ for US stocks like Apple).</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">3</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <h4>The market matches your buy with a seller</h4>
                            <p>Someone wants to sell 1 Apple share. The market maker or exchange puts you two together.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">4</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <h4>Money changes hands</h4>
                            <p>Your £150 goes to the seller. The spread (if any) goes to the market maker. Settlement happens in T+2 (2 business days).</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <span class="step-num">5</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <h4>Ownership transfers</h4>
                            <p>You now own the share. It's in your account. You own a tiny slice of Apple.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Why This All Matters</h2>
                <p>Understanding the mechanics changes how you invest:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your money funds previous investors, not (usually) the company.</strong> So buying popular stocks doesn't mean you're "supporting" the company — you're just trading with other investors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prices are opinions, not facts.</strong> They move on supply and demand, which is based on sentiment. This is why you can lose money in a good company if the market loses faith.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paper gains are delicious lies.</strong> They feel real but they're not. Only realised gains count. This is why day traders are emotional wrecks — they're chasing the paper dragon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market makers are just friction.</strong> They take a tiny cut, but they also ensure you can actually buy and sell whenever you want. That's valuable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Holding long-term defeats emotions.</strong> When you understand that today's price is just someone's opinion, it's easier not to panic when prices dip. <a href="what-is-compound-interest.html">Compound interest loves long-term holders</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>A Real Example: My First Stock Trade</h2>
                <p>I bought 5 shares of Kraken Robotics at £1.20. That £6 went to whoever was selling. Kraken didn't get it. Some market maker took 0.01p. I got 5 tiny pieces of a company building underwater robots.</p>

                <p>A week later, it rose to £1.50. Paper gain: £1.50. I didn't sell.</p>

                <p>A month later, it dropped to £0.80. Paper gain disappeared. Still didn't sell.</p>

                <p>The price moves because people are constantly changing their opinion on whether underwater robots are going to make money. My ownership didn't change. The company didn't change. The market's opinion changed.</p>

                <p>This is exactly why <a href="why-index-funds-are-actually-op.html">index funds are better for most people</a> — you're not trying to predict whether market opinions will be right or wrong. You own a bit of everything, ride the long-term wave, and let <a href="what-is-compound-interest.html">compound interest do the work</a>.</p>
