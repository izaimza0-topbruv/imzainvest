                <h1>Index Funds vs ETFs</h1>
                <p class="post-subtitle">They're basically the same thing. Here's the tiny difference.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="intro">
                    If you've started looking into investing, you've probably seen people argue about "index funds vs ETFs". Good news: they're almost identical. Here's what actually matters.
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>🎯 The Short Answer</h3>
                    <p>Both track a basket of stocks (like the FTSE 100 or S&P 500). The only real difference is <strong>how you buy them</strong>. Index funds are bought once per day; ETFs trade like shares throughout the day. For most beginners? It doesn't matter. Pick whichever is cheaper on your platform.</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>📌 Real Example</h4>
                    <p>Vanguard offers both:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Index Fund:</strong> FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund — 0.23% fee</li>
                        <li><strong>ETF:</strong> FTSE All-World ETF (VWRL) — 0.22% fee</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both track global stock markets. Both are from Vanguard. The ETF is 0.01% cheaper. That's the kind of difference we're talking about.</p>

                    <h4>🤷 Honestly?</h4>
                    <p>For Zo's portfolio, we use the <strong>Vanguard FTSE All-World ETF (VWRL)</strong> because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trading 212 offers it</li>
                        <li>Zero trading fees</li>
                        <li>Fractional shares (we can buy exactly £250 worth)</li>
                        <li>Low fee (0.22%)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But if we were using Vanguard directly, we'd probably use their index fund version. The difference is that small.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What About "Active" Funds?</h2>
                <p>Index funds and ETFs are <strong>passive</strong> — they just track an index. No one is picking stocks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Active funds</strong> have a fund manager trying to beat the market. Sounds good, but:</p>
                
                <div class="stats-box">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most active funds <strong>underperform</strong> the market over 10+ years</li>
                        <li>They charge higher fees (0.5-1.5% vs 0.1-0.3%)</li>
                        <li>Those fees compound against you</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Our take:</strong> For most people, passive index funds/ETFs are the smarter choice. Let the market do the work.</p>

                        <h3>Are ETFs riskier than index funds?</h3>
                        <p>No. They carry the same investment risk (both track the same underlying stocks). The only difference is how they're traded.</p>

                        <h3>Can I have both in my portfolio?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Some people use index funds for core holdings and ETFs for specific sectors. But for beginners, one global index fund/ETF is enough.</p>

                        <h3>Do ETFs pay dividends?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Most ETFs either pay out dividends (distributing) or reinvest them automatically (accumulating). Accumulating is easier — no need to reinvest yourself.</p>

                        <h3>What's an accumulating ETF?</h3>
                        <p>An ETF that automatically reinvests dividends. VWRL is distributing (pays out), but Vanguard also offers accumulating versions like VWCE. For long-term investing, accumulating is slightly more tax-efficient and hands-off.</p>

                <h2>UK Platforms: What Beginners Actually Use</h2>
                <p>In the UK, beginners often compare platforms like Vanguard Investor and Trading 212. Vanguard is simple and focused; Trading 212 offers wider choice and app-first experience. Neither is universally "best". The right choice depends on behaviour. If a platform makes you panic-trade, it's expensive even when fees look low.</p>
                <p>For a new investor, we care about four things: annual account/platform charges, fund ongoing costs (OCF), dealing/spread costs, and whether you can automate monthly investing. Small fee differences compound, but emotional mistakes can cost even more.</p>

                <h2>Cost Comparison Example (Simple Numbers)</h2>
                <p>Suppose you invest £5,000 initially and add £100 per month for 10 years. A total fee difference of just 0.30% per year may not look dramatic in one year, but over a decade it can mean hundreds of pounds less in your account. That's real money for a teen investor.</p>
                <p>Index funds and ETFs can both be low-cost. ETFs might look cheaper on OCF, but if you trade frequently you can lose that advantage through spread and behaviour. Index funds with monthly auto-invest can be boring in the best possible way.</p>

                <h2>ISA Wrappers: Don't Ignore Tax</h2>
                <p>For UK beginners, the tax wrapper often matters more than the product label. Holding either ETFs or index funds inside an ISA can shield gains and dividends from UK tax. We treat this as step one before debating tiny product differences.</p>
                <p>Teen investors should understand which account they are using (Junior ISA now, adult ISA later) and what the annual limits and access rules are.</p>

                <h2>Which Is Better for Beginners?</h2>
                <p>If you're new, have limited time, and want to build habit: a broad index fund with automatic monthly investing is usually easier to stick with. If you want intraday flexibility and understand spreads and order types, ETFs can work well. The key is to choose a setup you can follow for years, not weeks.</p>

                <h2>FAQ: ETFs vs Index Funds</h2>
                <h3>Can I hold both?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Many investors blend both depending on platform and strategy.</p>
                <h3>Does lower OCF always mean better?</h3>
                <p>No. Tracking quality, spreads, tax wrapper, and your behaviour matter too.</p>
                <h3>What should a 15-year-old focus on first?</h3>
                <p>Learning consistency, risk, and long-term thinking before trying to optimise tiny fee differences.</p>
