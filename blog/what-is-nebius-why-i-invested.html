                <p class="post-subtitle">An AI infrastructure play on the GPU shortage. Risky, but this was our reasoning for buying.</p>
            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p class="intro">
                    I put £2,476 into Nebius (NBIS) on 22 January 2026. Most people haven't heard of it. It's not Apple or Tesla. This is what we personally did, not a recommendation. Here's why we chose it.
                </p>

                <h2>What is Nebius? (The Boring Part First)</h2>
                <p>Nebius is a data centre company that rents GPU servers to artificial intelligence companies. That's it. That's the whole thing.</p>
                <p>When OpenAI trains ChatGPT, they buy GPU time. When Meta trains their AI models, they buy GPU time. When Microsoft works on their Copilot AI, they buy GPU time. Nebius is one of the companies selling that time.</p>
                <p>Think of it like Amazon Web Services (AWS), but optimised specifically for AI workloads.</p>

                <h2>But Wait—Why Haven't I Heard of Them?</h2>
                <p>Because Nebius only recently existed as a standalone company.</p>
                <p>They're the spin-off of Yandex's cloud division. Yandex is Russia's answer to Google—they had a massive search engine, email, maps, and cloud services. But when Russia was sanctioned in 2022, Yandex had to exit Russia and divest assets.</p>
                <p>The cloud business became Nebius, relocated operations to Amsterdam and other European hubs, and is now trading publicly on the LSE under ticker NBIS.</p>
                <p><strong>Why is this good news?</strong> Because Nebius is now outside Russia, working in the global AI market, and they have the infrastructure already built.</p>

                <h2>Core Reasoning: The GPU Shortage Is Real</h2>
                <p>Here's the thing about AI in 2025-2026: there's a massive shortage of GPUs.</p>
                <p>NVIDIA makes the best AI chips, but they can't manufacture fast enough. Every data centre on Earth wants GPUs. Every company building AI models wants GPUs. Demand vastly exceeds supply.</p>

                <div class="thesis-card">
                    <h4>💡 Why This Matters for Nebius</h4>
                    <p>If you're a company that wants to train an AI model, you have three options:</p>
                    <ol style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li>Buy your own GPUs (costs millions, takes months)</li>
                        <li>Rent from AWS (they're also constrained, and it's expensive)</li>
                        <li>Rent from Nebius (available capacity, competitive pricing, EU-based for compliance)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A lot of companies are picking option 3.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why Nebius is Winning (The Upside)</h2>
                <p>Nebius has several structural advantages right now:</p>

                <div class="advantage-grid">
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>📦 Spare Capacity</h4>
                        <p>While AWS and other giants are booked solid, Nebius still has available GPU capacity. That's like being the only petrol station in town when everyone's driving EVs—except they're not. Yet.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🌍 EU Location</h4>
                        <p>European companies and EU-regulated businesses need to keep data in Europe for GDPR compliance. Nebius's European data centres solve that problem. AWS has to be more expensive to meet EU regulations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>💰 Pricing</h4>
                        <p>Nebius undercuts AWS on GPU pricing because their cost structure is lower. That makes them attractive to budget-conscious AI startups and researchers.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🚀 Growth Rate</h4>
                        <p>Revenue is growing at triple-digit percentages. When you're a tiny company entering a massive market, that's what you see at first.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-item">
                        <h4>🤖 AI Tailwind</h4>
                        <p>Every breakthrough in AI (ChatGPT, Claude, new image models) drives more demand for compute. The tailwind is structural, not temporary.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>The Data Centre Demand Story</h2>
                <p>This is the part that got Dad interested too.</p>
                <p>Right now, there's a global shortage of data centre capacity. Companies like CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, and others are building new data centres specifically to serve AI workloads. It's a gold rush.</p>
                <p>Nebius is competing in this market, and they're well-positioned because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They already operate multiple data centres across Europe</li>
                    <li>They understand GPU-optimised architecture (built it for Yandex)</li>
                    <li>They have customer relationships with AI companies globally</li>
                    <li>They have proven operational expertise running cloud at scale</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This isn't a startup guessing how to run data centres. This is a proven operator entering a new market.</p>

                <h2>My Position: 34 Units at £72.83 Each</h2>
                <p>I bought 34 shares on 22 January 2026, averaging £72.83 per share.</p>
                <p>Total invested: £2,476.</p>
                <p>That's a large position for a 15-year-old. Honestly, it's where I currently have the most conviction. I think Nebius could be worth £150-200+ per share in 3-5 years if the AI infrastructure demand continues, but this is what we personally did, not a recommendation.</p>

                <div class="thesis-card">
                    <h4>🎯 My Price Target</h4>
                    <p>If Nebius captures even 5% of the global AI infrastructure market and maintains a healthy profit margin, the stock could easily 3-4x. That's not prediction—that's just math based on addressable market size.</p>
                    <p>But if AI demand slows or competition intensifies, the stock could fall 50%. That's why this is a high-risk, high-conviction bet, not a "safe" play.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Risks (Why This Could Blow Up)</h2>
                <p>And honestly, there are a lot of reasons it could.</p>

                <div class="risks-grid">
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">📉</span>
                        <h4>AI Winter</h4>
                        <p>What if the hype around AI cools? What if the returns on AI investment don't materialise? GPU demand could collapse overnight.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">🏭</span>
                        <h4>Supply Normalises</h4>
                        <p>As NVIDIA ramps production and new fabs come online, the GPU shortage might ease. That kills Nebius's pricing power.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">💪</span>
                        <h4>AWS Fights Back</h4>
                        <p>Amazon is not going to sit idle. They could aggressively expand capacity, undercut prices, or acquire competitors. Nebius could lose market share fast.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">💸</span>
                        <h4>Valuation Risk</h4>
                        <p>The stock is expensive on forward valuations. If growth slows even slightly, the valuation multiple compresses and the stock falls hard.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">⚖️</span>
                        <h4>Geopolitical Risk</h4>
                        <p>New sanctions, export controls, or regulations could damage Nebius's operations or market access. Being a Yandex spin-off means they're watched closely.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="risk-item">
                        <span class="risk-icon">👥</span>
                        <h4>Execution Risk</h4>
                        <p>Scaling a data centre business is hard. Supply chain delays, technical glitches, or management missteps could slow growth.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Why I Can Afford This Risk</h2>
                <p>This is important: I can only take this risk because my portfolio is not all Nebius.</p>
                <p>My portfolio is roughly 60% <a href="why-index-funds-are-actually-op.html">low-cost index funds</a>, 25% individual stock picks (Kraken, Nebius, KR1), and 15% cash.</p>
                <p>The index funds are the ballast. The individual stocks are where I take higher risk. If Nebius crashes, I'm still on track for my £60k uni fund goal because the index funds are doing their job.</p>
                <p><strong>That's how you take big risks without burning down your entire portfolio.</strong></p>

                <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>
                <p>I'm not a passive holder. I'm tracking a few metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revenue growth.</strong> Is it still accelerating or slowing? If growth drops below 50% YoY, I'd reconsider.</li>
                    <li><strong>GPU pricing trends.</strong> Are prices staying elevated or collapsing? Collapsing prices = lower profit margins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive landscape.</strong> New entrants like CoreWeave are raising billions. Are they stealing market share?</li>
                    <li><strong>Earnings reports.</strong> Is the company actually profitable yet, or just burning cash? Profitability matters at these valuations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyst reports.</strong> What do institutional investors think? If they're rotating out, it's a red flag.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The AI Infrastructure Megatrend</h2>
                <p>Here's why I currently like this space, even if Nebius specifically has risks:</p>
                <p>We're in the early innings of the AI arms race. Every tech company needs to build or buy AI infrastructure. This is similar to the cloud computing boom of 2010-2020, where AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud became trillion-pound businesses.</p>
                <p>Infrastructure companies are less sexy than the AI apps themselves (ChatGPT, etc.), but they're more profitable. They're like the companies that sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.</p>
                <p>Nebius is aiming to be one of those picks-and-shovels companies for the AI era.</p>

                <h2>Should You Buy Nebius?</h2>
                <p>Honestly? I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's a high-risk, high-growth trade. If you're 15 like me and have a 50+ year time horizon, volatility doesn't scare you.</p>
                <p>But if you're closer to retirement or can't afford to lose £2,500, stick with <a href="why-index-funds-are-actually-op.html">index funds</a>. They're boring, but they work.</p>
