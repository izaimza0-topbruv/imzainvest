            <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
            <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

            <h2>What This Means (In Plain English)</h2>
            <p>Some links on this website are "affiliate links." If you click them and sign up for something, we might earn a small commission. It costs you nothing extra.</p>
            <p>This helps fund Zo's university journey. But we only recommend things we actually use and trust.</p>

            <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You click a link on our site (e.g., to Trading 212)</li>
                <li>If you sign up, the company pays us a small referral fee</li>
                <li>You pay the same price as normal — the company pays us, not you</li>
                <li>We might earn £10-50 per signup depending on the platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What We Promote (And Why)</h2>
            <p>We only recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Platforms and tools we personally use</li>
                <li>Products we've researched and believe in</li>
                <li>Services that are genuinely useful for UK teen investors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We <strong>never</strong> recommend something just because it pays well. If a product is bad, we won't promote it — even if they offer us money.</p>

            <h2>How to Spot an Affiliate Link</h2>
            <p>Look for links that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go through <code>imzainvest.com/go/[platform]</code></li>
                <li>Have "[affiliate link]" next to them</li>
                <li>Are on our Resources page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not every external link is an affiliate link. Many are just helpful resources.</p>

            <h2>Does This Change Our Content?</h2>
            <p><strong>No.</strong> Our content is based on our real journey, real experiences, and real opinions. We don't let affiliate relationships influence what we write.</p>
            <p>If we think a platform has downsides, we'll tell you. Check our Resources page — we list "Keep in Mind" sections for every platform, even the ones we're affiliated with.</p>

            <h2>Legal Stuff (For Transparency)</h2>
            <h3>UK Advertising Standards</h3>
            <p>We comply with the <strong>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)</strong> Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (CAP Code). This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such</li>
                <li>We must not mislead about our commercial intent</li>
                <li>All claims must be truthful and accurate</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Financial Promotion Disclaimer</h3>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This website provides general information about investing for educational purposes only. It is <strong>NOT</strong> financial advice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</li>
                <li>We are not qualified financial advisors</li>
                <li>All investments carry risk — you could lose money</li>
                <li>Always do your own research and consult a qualified professional if needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Questions?</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or want to know if a specific link is an affiliate link, just ask. We're happy to be transparent.</p>
